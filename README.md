COVID-19 in India Project

This project aims to analyze and visualize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The data is collected from Kaggle.

The Objective of the project is to track the progression of COVID-19 cases, including confirmed, recovered, and deceased individuals, across different states and regions of India.

I have used Excel for basic data cleaning and Tableau to analyze and visualize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India.
