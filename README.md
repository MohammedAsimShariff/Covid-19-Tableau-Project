# COVID-19 in India Project

The COVID-19 in India project aims to analyze and visualize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The Objective of this project is to track the progression of COVID-19 cases, including confirmed, recovered, and deceased individuals, across different states and regions, the project provides valuable insights into the pandemic's spread and impact.

I have analyzed the data and created some visuals to find the some key insights like the top 10 states with the highest number of COVID-19-related deaths, confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered COVID-19 cases and daily trends of new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in India.
